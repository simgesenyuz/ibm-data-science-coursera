&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A database containing multiple tables (EMPLOYEES, JOB_HISTORY, JOBS, and DEPARTMENTS) is constructed by reading data from .csv files. 
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some queries applied to the database (e.g. finding distinct number of Jobs, finding the employees within a specific salary range, finding the average salary of employees in distinct departments etc.). The results of the queries are represented with pandas dataframes.
