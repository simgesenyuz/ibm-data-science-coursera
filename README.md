* &nbsp; HR Database, Related codes: [Building HR Database and Analysis of Data](Databases_and_SQL/HR_Database/hr_db_analysis.ipynb), [Analysis of Employees Data in HR Database](Databases_and_SQL/HR_Database/hr_employees_analysis.ipynb) <br /> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A database containing multiple tables (EMPLOYEES, JOB_HISTORY, JOBS, and DEPARTMENTS) is constructed by reading data from .csv files. <br /> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some queries applied to the database (e.g. finding distinct number of Jobs, finding the employees within a specific salary range, finding the average salary of employees in distinct departments, DATE TIME related analysis etc.). The results of the queries are represented with pandas dataframes. <br /> <br />

* &nbsp; Pet Rescue Database, Related codes: [Building Pet Rescue Database](Databases_and_SQL/Pet_Rescue_Database/create_database.ipynb), [Analysis of the Data in Pet Rescue Database](Databases_and_SQL/Pet_Rescue_Database/analyze_pet_rescue_data.ipynb)  <br /> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A database containing a table (PETRESCUE) is constructed by inserting values manually. <br /> <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Some queries applied to the database (e.g. Total, rounded, and average costs of rescuing an animal, string operations on table values, DATE TIME related analysis such as the number of rescued animals in a given month etc.). The results of the queries are represented with pandas dataframes. <br /> <br />
